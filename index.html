                      Oh no! You and your friend have been tasked to help Professor Oak with his research, but don't know his password. Luckily, the professor has left clues to figure it out in your respective labs. Can you solve the pokemon-themed puzzles before the non-existent timer runs out? Play remotely or in the same room with a friend (or by yourself with two screens I won't judge)

            <li>Taking notes is very helpful, but try not to show your partner your notes</li>
            <li>Unless you have encyclopedic knowledge about the entire Pokemon series, you WILL need to look things up</li>
            <li>Remember that your partner cannot see your screen. Most clues will require "something" from both of you, so be sure to describe everything</li>
